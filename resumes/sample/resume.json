    "summary": "Richard hails from <strong>Tulsa</strong>. He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for <a href='http://www.hooli.xyz/'>Hooli</a> as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a <em>“length-limited”</em> conversation!",
