All done! You'll be able to access your live site at `https://<github_username>.github.io/google-resume`

## Advanced (Optional)

Want to preview your resume before pushing?

Get [NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) first

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npx playwright install chromium
    ```

2.  To build a specific resume, run the `build-resume.sh` script with the `FILE_PATH` environment variable:
    ```bash
    FILE_PATH=resumes/data-scientist ./scripts/build-resume.sh
    ```

Youâ€™ll find the generated `index.html`, `resume.html`, and `resume.pdf` inside the `resumes/data-scientist/` folder.

## Summary

1.  You make a copy of the `resumes/sample` directory to a new one (e.g. `resumes/google/`).
2.  You modify the `resume.json` file in this `resumes/google/` with your actual details.
3.  You push your code to GitHub so GitHub Actions automatically builds the site and PDF.
4.  The output is deployed to a separate resume repository (e.g., `google-resume`) with GitHub Pages enabled.
5.  If you delete any resume folder, the corresponding repository is also deleted.

This lets you keep your resumes repository separate from the live resume websites.

Happy Job Hunting!
